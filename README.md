# Reversing a Linked List with Ruby 2.5.3

In practice it's hard to think about how to reverse a Linked List if you don't take a step and think about the problem in a different light.

In coding, there are some problems that are incredibly easy if you rethink the problem - but basically impossible to solve without thinking through in a different light. This is one such example.

Here's a diagram about how you can reverse a linked list. Read the diagram starting at the top-left corner and go counter-clock-wise when reading it. I found it very helpful when building my solution

In this exerice I’ll reverse a linear linked list by treating it as a stack.

## How to Use

***This was tested using Ruby version - 2.5.3p105.***

1. Clone this repository or download a zip of it.
2. CD into the directory holding the `linked_lists.rb`
3. run the following command from your terminal

```ruby
ruby  linked_lists.rb
```
